# Patchy_Dynamics
This repository contains source data and computer programming codes for "A ‘rich-get-richer’ mechanism drives patchy dynamics and resistance evolution in antibiotic-treated bacteria", currently under review at Molecular Systems Biology. 

Due to the 25 MB limit of a single folder upload, Figure EV5, and Appendix Figures S13, S15 were uploaded in 3, 10, and 2 parts, respectively.
